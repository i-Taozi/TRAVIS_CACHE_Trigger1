ProvToolbox is a Java library to create Java representations of
PROV-DM, and convert them between RDF, PROV-XML, PROV-N, and PROV-JSON


Provenance is a record that describes the people, institutions,
entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or
delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance
of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be
trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information
sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In
an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find
information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance
can help those users to make trust judgements.

PROV is a set of W3C specifications defining a model, corresponding
serializations and other supporting definitions to enable the
inter-operable interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous
environments such as the Web.
