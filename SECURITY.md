# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support BigBlueButton through the community forums and through security updates.

| 2.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.4.x Â  | :white_check_mark: |

We have released 2.4 to the community and are going to support both 2.4 and 2.3 together for the coming months (while we're actively developing the next release).  Also, BigBlueButton 2.2 is running on Ubuntu 16.04 which is now end of life.

As such, we recommend that all administrators deploy 2.4 going forward.  You'll find [many improvements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.4/new.html) in this newer version.
